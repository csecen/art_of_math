### Double Pendulum

#### This function produces serveral different visualizations for the double pendulum. These variations include multiple pendulums swinging in a gif, stills of the trace a single pendulum makes, and an animation of the full path and just a temporary trace. 

#### The double pendulum can be described as a chaotic system, which is shown well in the multi-pendulum animation. Each pendulum is created with all the same variables aside from a very slight variation to the starting angle. While this difference is very small, it makes a very large impact on how the double pendulum will behave. It can be seem in the animation below that all the pendulums start out behaving similarly, but after a few seconds, their behaviors change and a choatic pattern emerges.

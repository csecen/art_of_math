### Equation Graphs

#### This function plots two different equations, one forming a heart and the other forming a four leaf clover. The concept of this function is rather simple, but shows that from complex equations simple and known structures can be formed.

#### The following is an example call for the equations graph function and an example output of the four leaf clover:
